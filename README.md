APCS2 Final Project -- Tower Defense Game

Shakil Rafi, Alitquan Mallick, Arif Roktim

This project is a tower defense game. Enemies are spawned at the beginning of a path and they travel along it until they reach the endpoint. While traveling down the path, towers, which are placed by the player, shoot at the enemies until they reach the endpoint or their health is diminished to zero. Every time an enemy reaches the endpoint, the player's overall health is decreased. The game is over when the player's health is decreased to zero and they receive a score based on how many enemies they have defeated.

Upon launching the project, a main menu is opened. From this menu, the player can choose a map to play. After the user clicks on the map they would like to play, the game is launched with that map loaded. From there on, the player can click on any grass tile on the map to place a tower there. Towers that have been places can later be upgraded by clicking on them and then on the desired upgrade. The user can choose to start the game whenever they are ready and enemies are continually spawned in from then on.
